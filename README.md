[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/be7ecece1d1047fa9480741d5b72cf14)](https://www.codacy.com?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=aljorhythm/CS3219-CIR-visualisation&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

Due to the way the human brain processes information, using charts or graphs to visualize large amounts of complex information allows human to understand and retain information better. Data visualization is a quick way to communicate information in a visual way and highlight trends/patterns in the information. In this assignment, first 200,000 lines from the full dataset at [http://labs.semanticscholar.org/corpus/](http://labs.semanticscholar.org/corpus/) are used to create visualization using d3.js.

The overall aim of CIR is to provide Simon with a usable interface which accepts his intuitive queries and provides him with outputs/visualizations to help him analyze various aspects of research publications. In particular, Simon is interested in trend-based queries.
